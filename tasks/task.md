[Global] - Desktop Header


Description

Build out the global header based on these figma designs - I have added the figma file and node ids as environment variables. If figma Mcp isn't working at all let me know. If it is working, but you're not able to access enough data, let me know what you are able to access and what is missing. - Let me know explicitly what assets/menus you need me to add on the Shopify admin side. I am going to skip adding the correct fonts for now until design gives me font files. I added
the logo in theme settings. I don't want to use an inverse logo. Make sure to update schemas/settings to I can see this new desktop header as soon as I view this theme again. (this implementation is desktop only, we will do mobile next)
